# Act App Front End Repository

This repository contains the front-end code for an application designed to be used as a sort of social media site for people involved with activism.

The back end repository can be found here: https://github.com/gercks/Act-App-Back-End

The deployed database can be found here: https://evening-oasis-55074.herokuapp.com/events

And the deployed front end can be found here: https://gercks.github.io/Act-App-Front-End/

## Technologies used

This application was made using:

HTML
CSS
Javascript
jQuery

## How it was made

I began this project by creating a functional back end database using Ruby and Ruby on Rails, the link to which can be found above. Then, I began on this repository.

My first priority was to connect the front end to the back end, which I was able to do using ajax.

In terms of HTML and CSS, it was important to me to have the first thing users see be authorization actions, and I achieved this using jQuery. I then moved on to implementing forms for users to fill out once signed in. Finally, I used handlebars to display items from the database in an organized way.

The biggest struggle I continue to have with the front end is mastering CSS floats, which was an ongoing problem while developing this project. I look forward to having that down pat!

## Improvements for next time

Most of the improvments I would make next time are related to the back end, but of course that would affect the front end as well. I would like for users to be able to RSVP to events and to search for events by name or date, but I didn't have enough time to make that happen this time around.

## User Stories and Wireframes

Here is the original wireframe for this project: https://imgur.com/a/AKkh9

When building this game, I kept the following user stories in mind.

I am able to create my own account, sign in and out, and change my password as needed.
I am able to create, delete, and update my own events.
I am able to see all of the events posted on the app by other users.
Other users are not able to do anything but view my events.
